# responsive-eblast---cabi
redesign of cabi's eblasts

Responsive Eblast for cabi created by Heather C. Keiser with use of MJML

There are 3 files here consisting of an html, a mjml, and php.

The html file is what a finished eblast should look like when sent out from
a cabi stylist to one of their clients. There are placeholders for all the
dynamic content and links go to the general cabi site so that they are functional.

The php file has dynamic insert points for any text/links that would change based
off of user content.

The mjml file is the file before output to html. Several work arounds were done in
visual formatting between this and the the outputted html file above, but there are a
few comments in here pointing out where those work arounds need to happen. Mainly
the sizing of the table that holds the logos at the top and bottom of the page
being dynamic where mjml does not have the functionality to do so.
